The thinking inside your business should always be a few steps ahead of where the market is at and so that is why I feel comfortable making this statement, which whilst not 100% true right now, is fast on it's way to becoming so...

Business that want to succeed in the long-term must be purpose driven. That purpose must be based on shared values of the people IN the business and the people dealing WITH the business. It's not about 'customer-centricity' it's about being human.
